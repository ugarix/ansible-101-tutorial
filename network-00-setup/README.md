The IOS-XR Vagrant image was built utilizing Hank Preston's github tool at 
https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog under box_building.

Once the vagrant images exist on your machine you can bring this up via the following command.  It takes a few minutes for this VM to start.
```
vagrant up
```
When you are finished you can remove the VM and reclaim your space by issuing
```
vagrant destroy
```
